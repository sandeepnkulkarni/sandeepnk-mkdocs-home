**.NET Core** is an open source, multi-platform, and multi-purpose runtime for .NET applications developed by Microsoft.

You can create .NET Core apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux for x64, x86, ARM32, and ARM64 processors using a variety of languages, like C# and F#. It provides frameworks and APIs for new age techonologies like cloud, IoT, and machine learning as well.

You will need to use .NET Core SDK for development purpose. The .NET Core SDK is a set of libraries and tools that allow developers to create .NET Core applications and libraries. 

The .NET Core runtime is used to run a .NET Core app and may or may not be included with the app. The .NET Core runtime is always installed with the .NET Core SDK.

The latest version of .NET Core is 3.1 and it is the latest LTS release supported till 2022-12-03. Another version 2.1 is also declared a LTS release and will be supported till 2021-08-21. 

.NET 5.0 will be next major release and will be a unified platform and the next step forward with .NET Core. It aims to improve .NET in a few key ways:

* Produce a single .NET runtime and framework that can be used everywhere and that has uniform runtime behaviors and developer experiences.
* Expand the capabilities of .NET by taking the best of .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin and Mono.
* Build that product out of a single code-base that developers (Microsoft and the community) can work on and expand together and that improves all scenarios. 

.NET 5.0 is currently in preview mode and it is currently scheduled to be released in November 2020. While .NET 5 will debut in November 2020, it won't be a long-term support (LTS) release, which are eligible for free support for three years. Going forward, Microsoft plans to ship major .NET releases every year in November, with even-numbered releases being LTS versions. So .NET 6 will be the next LTS offering, scheduled for November 2021.

Highlights of .NET 5 include:

* Developers will have more choice on runtime experiences.
* Java interoperability will be available on all platforms.
* Objective-C and Swift interoperability will be supported on multiple operating systems.
* CoreFX will be extended to support static compilation of .NET, smaller footprints and support for more operating systems.
