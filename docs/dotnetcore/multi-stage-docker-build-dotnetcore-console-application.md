title: 'Multi-stage Docker build of self-contained .NET Core console application'
---

In this tutorial, we will use multi-stage Docker builds to illustrate how we can build an application in the first stage and in next stage, use the output from first stage to create an application image. A multi-stage build is done by creating different sections of a Dockerfile, each referencing a different base image. This allows a multi-stage build to fulfill a function previously filled by using multiple Dockerfiles, copying files between containers, or running different pipelines.

Refer to section **Create new console application** in [Create your first .NET Core console application on Ubuntu](create-first-dotnetcore-console-app-on-ubuntu.md) to understand basics about how to create .NET Core console application. We will re-use the application created here.

## Multi-stage Docker file

In the application build stage, we will use `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.1` as base image. We will copy source code inside the container and publish a self-contained application. We will use `linux-musl-x64` as runtime configuration since we are using Apline as base image as mentioned below. Output for this stage will be available in `/source/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.1/linux-musl-x64/publish/`.

Next stage we will create application image which will consume the output from build stage. We will use `amd64/alpine:3.12` as base image this time. It is a very small image with size 5.57 MB. However, to be able to sucessfully run .NET Core applications, we will need to install few packages. The list of packages is mentioned in <https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/src/runtime-deps/2.1/alpine3.12/amd64/Dockerfile>.

We will also add two environment variables `DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER` and `DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT` and set them to `true` as suggested by Microsoft.

`DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER` variable is used to detect whether the .NET Core application is running inside the container.

`DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT` is used to enable Globalization Invariant Mode. 

In earlier tutorial we had added following line under `<PropertyGroup>` tag in `hellodocker.csproj`:

```xml
<InvariantGlobalization>true</InvariantGlobalization>
```

As we are using `DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT`, we can remove that line from `hellodocker.csproj` this time.

Final Dockerfile contents:

```docker
# Create application build

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.1 AS build-env

WORKDIR /source

COPY *.csproj ./

RUN dotnet restore

COPY . ./

RUN dotnet publish --configuration Release --self-contained true --runtime linux-musl-x64

# Create application image

FROM amd64/alpine:3.12

RUN apk add --no-cache \
    ca-certificates \
    # .NET Core dependencies
    krb5-libs libgcc libintl libssl1.1 zlib \
    libstdc++ lttng-ust tzdata userspace-rcu

# Enable detection of running in a container
ENV DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true

# Set the invariant mode since icu_libs isn't included (see https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/20)
ENV DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=true

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build-env /source/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.1/linux-musl-x64/publish/ .

ENTRYPOINT ["./hellodocker"]
```

To increase the build's performance, exclude files and directories, create a `.dockerignore` file in the same directory as `Dockerfile` with following contents:

```text
Dockerfile
[b|B]in/
[O|o]bj/
```

Now that our `Dockerfile` is ready along with `.dockerignore` file, we can run `docker build` command like below:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    docker build -t hellodocker:3.0 .
    ```

=== "Sample output"

    ```text

    Successfully tagged hellodocker:3.0
    ```

We have tagged the image with `3.0`, so that we can differentiate it with earlier Docker images created earlier for helloDocker application. We will use the earlier images to do a size comparison later.

We can verify that the `hellodocker` application still runs without any issue with below command:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ docker run --name hellodocker3 hellodocker:3.0
    ```

=== "Sample output"

    ```text
    Hello Docker!
    ```

## Docker size comparison

Now let us try to do a size comparison for Docker images created earlier with the latest image:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ docker images
    ```

=== "Sample output"

    ```text
    REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
    hellodocker         3.0                 67bdd4ac2207        About a minute ago   86.4MB
    hellodocker         2.0                 9ff4eeed6631        3 days ago           138MB
    hellodocker         1.0                 0a19597e8d5e        4 days ago           180MB
    ```

`hellodocker:1.0` was created with `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:2.1` as base image. This base image itself has size of around 180 MB. As our application was not published as self-contained, it required .Net runtime installed to run. Application size was only 24 KB.

`hellodocker:2.0` was created with `ubuntu:18.04` as base image. This base image still has size of around 64 MB. Our application was published as self-contained, it did not require .Net runtime installed to run. However, application size had grown to 71.2 MB. Hence, the resultant size of image was 138 MB.

`hellodocker:3.0` we have created just now uses `alpine:3.12` as base image. This base image is just 5.57 MB in size. But in order to run .NET Core applications, we have to install few packages as mentioned in the `Dockerfile`. Here the size of Docker image is just 86.4 MB. That is a significant reduction in size in comparison to 180 MB.

If we take a look at the layers within Docker image, we get more idea:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ docker history hellodocker:3.0
    ```

=== "Sample output"

    ```text

    ```

In .NET Core 3.0 onward, there is an additional option `p:PublishTrimmed` to further reduce the size of self-contained executable. We will cover that option as well in another tutorial. You can refer to link given in [References](#references) section below to take a look at it.
